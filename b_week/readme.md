I’m excited to share this journey! 

I take notes during every meeting and have many handwritten notes that I’ll be importing gradually as I analyze them individually again.

I’m thrilled about the opportunity to work with professionals from the USDA Forest Service and receive their guidance. I’m also looking forward to collaborating with a dynamic team that shares my enthusiasm.
I am so thrilled by the amount of new things I am learning as I explore many aspect of Geo Spatial Data Analysis!


You'll notice that I’m an avid gh user, and I’m committed to keeping my repositories organized and well-documented.

Please be patient as my repo is currently under construction!

Thank you for exploring. <br>
Have a nice day! (:
